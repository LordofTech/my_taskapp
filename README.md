## Django Task Management Application

This is a Django application for managing tasks, including tracking changes made to tasks.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
   - pip (package installer for Python) - usually comes with Python installation
   - Git ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of your repository.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   - Virtual environments isolate project dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects.
   - Choose a virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv`. See their documentation for specific commands.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Using venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Create a Database:**
   - Choose a database backend (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and follow its setup instructions.
   - Update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py` to connect to your database.

6. **Run Migrations:**
   - Apply database schema changes from your models:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

7. **Create a Superuser:**
   - Create a superuser account for initial administrative access:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
     Enter a username, email, and password when prompted.

8. **Run the Development Server:**
   - Start the Django development server to access the application in your browser:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - The default address is usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

**Usage**

- Access the application in your browser using the URL provided by the development server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).
- You can create, update, and delete tasks, and potentially view task history (implementation details may vary depending on your development).

**Additional Notes**

- This is a basic setup guide. Refer to the Django documentation for more advanced topics: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)
- Consider using a production server like Gunicorn or uWSGI for deploying your application in a production environment.
